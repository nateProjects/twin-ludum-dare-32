You are a butterfly, the most seemingly harmless of all the insect world. But, unknown to the human world, butterflies can communicate with each other by sending extra sensory messages through their antennas. When they are all in touch, in tune and in agreement with each other they can become a common mind and act as one.

Time is running out to prevent the end of almost all life on earth if you don&#x27;t act quickly.

The more clever and hardy ones carry out a plan to change the ocean stream and route of the warmer winds and melt the polar ice caps.

In all there is a massive loss of human life, especially in coastal regions and flatlands. Not enough to make mankind extinct, but enough to put them back by decades and put off their end by nature until hopefully they realize the cost of their actions.

Many butterflies die in this process too, with some species disappearing entirely, but some have lived on and if this situation arises again hopefully there will be enough of them to do something.
